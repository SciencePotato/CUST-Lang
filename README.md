## How does a Language Interpreter work?

What is a programming language? Well, it should just be a program
that executes and does magical stuff. To understand it a bit more
I decide to try to write a language interpreter. This project, I'll write a super basic language.

### Tokens, Errors, Lexer
Tokens are the fundamental building blocks. You can think of Token as a character in a word. Tokens combines together to make Statement / Expression, which I would explain later.

### Parser

### Abstract Syntax Tree

## What's the purpose of making this?

Honestly, I don't think it's just a good learning lessons. It's like learning the composition of a language, how it works together and why it works together. Besides, it's a cool project.
